This is the README for my self-taught project on Node.js, as one of the few steps I bring my tech stack into full stack and my github profile back to live.

The tutotial that I would be following is here: https://github.com/nswbmw/N-blog  
Other learning materials are here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side

Daily progress and notes will be in seperated documents.
